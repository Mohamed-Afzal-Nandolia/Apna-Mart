Errors:

1. Response to preflight request

Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8085/category' from origin 'http://localhost:3000'
has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control
check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

From the front end,

  export const getAllCategories = () => {
    return axios.get(REST_API_BASE_URL + "/category", {headers: {Authorization: localStorage.getItem("Authorization")}});
  };

To solve this type of error, just add '/' at the end of the request.

  export const getAllCategories = () => {
    return axios.get(REST_API_BASE_URL + "/category/", {headers: {Authorization: localStorage.getItem("Authorization")}});
  };
